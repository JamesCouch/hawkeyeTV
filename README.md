ELAUQSAP
==============
My first attempt at a Single-Page Web Application. I choose to use the boiler plate from Alex Ehrnschwender and modify it for my needs while I learn the basics.

Features added:
  * Current Blog Posting
  * Open DNS Resolver Subnet Scanner
  * RSS Info Sec Feed
  * More to come...

Features from the boiler plate:
  * CSRF headers in authentication requests to prevent forgery
  * Auth state persistence through signed cookies
  * Global (singleton) session model whose state changes can be listened to 
  * Client-side validations through ParsleyJS
  * Salt/hashing of passwords for back-end storage
